# cyberPhysicalSystem
Artificial Intelligence for Securing Industrial-Based Cyber- Physical Systems.

CYBER-PHYSICAL systems (CPS) can be seen as the combination of computation,
communication, and physical processes, where embedded computation and networking can control
physical devices. The combination of machines, sensors, embedded computational intelligence, and
communication mechanisms allow CPS to monitor and control physical components through computer-
based algorithms strongly supported by internet connectivity as well as in the Internet of Things (IoT).

PROPOSED SYSTEM : Multilevel interactive attention neural network.
